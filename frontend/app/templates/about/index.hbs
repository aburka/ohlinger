    <p>For the past several years my paintings have been an examination of what “Identity” means and how I, as a contemporary artist, challenge the conventions of traditional portrait painting. Though the images present a feeling of intimacy, I try to remain discreet and keep the viewer at a respectful distance; protecting the subject’s full identity. Showing a portion of the subject in a grand way gives the viewer insight into something that would normally be inaccessible – the fascinating details we seldom get close enough to see in person. The only clue of the identity of the individual is revealed through my titles, which are always the name by which I was introduced to the person. My work examines how we as viewers still seek recognition of the subject even when given only a limited view of the person’s appearance and identity.</p>
    <p>Historically, we are all familiar with the grand portraits of world leaders, nobility and the great patrons of society. But in today’s age, they don’t serve much purpose other than decoration for currency. We are so inundated with imagery that it becomes difficult to recount something we may have seen only minutes earlier. We encounter so many people on a daily basis, that we rarely notice the individual sitting at the table next to us in a restaurant. My work is about taking notice, and hopefully discovering the unique identity of the individuals depicted and also the people you will encounter today.</p>
    <p>In 2012 I began a series that is a different take on portraiture by completing at least one work from every stop on the F train in New York City. I selected this particular line because of the diversity and span of New York City that it supports. From Queens to Manhattan, through Brooklyn and on to Coney Island, riders on the F train experience all the city has to offer. The subway system hosts one of the most elegant dance performances you will ever see, and it's free to anyone who takes the time to watch.</p>
    <p>At every station, dozens and sometimes hundreds of times a day, a train load of passengers is delivered and you get to watch this amazing ballet of people moving quickly in both directions, instinctively finding the path of least resistance through the station either down into the tunnels or up to the concrete streets above. This dance often approaches - but rarely crosses - the line into chaos; then as quickly as it started, all of a sudden it's over. The train departs and you're left with a moment of calm until the next train arrives and the dance begins again.</p>
    <p>That calm moment between trains is what I want to capture in this series. In that moment, the station simply becomes a structure filled with amazing tile work, graffiti, and layers of grime earned over years of serving the city. I want to paint portraits of these locations. To take the time to really see them, and through my paintings hopefully help others to see the beauty that surrounds them every day.</p>
